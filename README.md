### Create a New API Key

In order to communicate with your database, you will need to create an API key. This will allow you to log in and execute the API on your database. It is important to understand that the API populates your server database and not your local database. To see the changes, you will need to synchronize your Claritysoft Application with the server, unless you use www.claritysoftcrm.com through your browser. 

To create your API key, follow those steps:

1.	Open https://api.claritycrm.com/  

2.	Under Getting Started, select the link to create a new API key.

3.	Login with your Claritysoft user name, password, and server database name.

4.	Click Submit

5.	Select Create New API key

6.	Click Submit. There is no need to fill in any values.
